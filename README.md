This tool was build using very minimal outside modules aside from what comes with the default Python Package. TKinter is a GUI platform that comes with Python, so running and installing this tool is as simple as loading python3.9, and then the few modules I specify below.

Here's the list of the modules in case you are having troubles.

generally a pip3 install <module> will do the trick.
 

tkinter
webbrowser
subprocess 
re
codecs
requests
pymsteams
configparser
